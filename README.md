Change Log:
-----------

### 5.0.0
- Added an "Open Tabs" section to the options page that lists tabs from all windows.
- Features: search/filter, sortable columns (Title, URL, Window), per-tab "Add" button, "Add All Tabs" and "Refresh Tabs".
- Window names are derived from each window's active tab title for easier identification.
- UI/Files affected: src/tab.html, src/tab.js, src/tab.css.
- Removed persistent identity permission from the manifest; identity is now requested on-demand (via runtime request) or surfaced as a CTA to open Chrome People/Sync settings.
- Added a Permissions panel to the options page showing declared and granted permissions with short descriptions.
- Added background service worker (background.js) to handle the keyboard command for adding the current page.
- Changed suggested keyboard shortcut to Ctrl+Shift+Y (and platform equivalents) to avoid conflicts; remind users they can reassign under chrome://extensions/shortcuts.
- Manifest now includes the "tabs" permission required for the new Open Tabs UI.
- UI/Files affected: src/manifest.json, src/tab.html, src/tab.js, src/tab.css, src/background.js.
- Fixed a small syntax bug in download JSON generation (missing parenthesis) that prevented the options script from executing.
- Minor UX tweaks: "Clear saved links" button wired to the existing clear handler and the saved/tabs lists refresh after clearing.
- Files: src/tab.js, src/core.js, src/tab.html.

## Notes
- After manifest/service-worker changes reload the extension (chrome://extensions â†’ Reload).
- If the keyboard shortcut does not trigger, check chrome://extensions/shortcuts and reassign as needed.
